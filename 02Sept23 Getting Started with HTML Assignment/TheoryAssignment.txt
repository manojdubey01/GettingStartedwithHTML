Ans:
Comments in HTML serve as non-rendered text that provides information about the code for human readers.
They are useful for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts
of the code without deleting them. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the rendering of the webpage.

The first comment provides an explanation about the purpose of the heading.
The second comment is used to disable the paragraph temporarily. If you remove the <!-- and --> around
the <p> tag, the paragraph will be displayed again.

Question 4: Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?
Ans:

HTML Tags: Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol.
Whatever written inside < and > are called tags. Tags are of two types. Opening Tag and Closing Tag.

Example: 
<b>This tag will make the text bold </b>

Here,
Opening Tag = <b>
Closing Tag = </b>
and content = "This tag will make the text bold"

Tags ususally comes in pairs, first Opening tag and the then closing tag with the name of the element enclosed within the tag.


Element: An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Example:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
